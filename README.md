# ScrapeJobs
Scraping jobs

Python project.
Scrapes jobs from the vdab website (Belgian official job seekers site) and converts them to json.
Very rough around the edges still and will probably be left in this state.
Part of a bigger hobby project.

Disclaimer: Scraping is a delicate subject and I'm just using this to demonstrate my abilities and to facility my job search for myself, 
since the site itself lacks some basic features (IMHO) like a 'not for me'/'already seen this' button and more advanced filtering (on location for example).
You shouldn't use this commercially, try to apply for API access.
